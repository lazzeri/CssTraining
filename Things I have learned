Box Model:

//If padding and border should stay in width %
box-sizing: content-box;


Selectors:

article p:first-of-type {
  color: red;
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

Data types are cool
[data-type='primary'] {
  color: red;
}

Instead of looking for a specific value of data-type, you can also look for elements with the attribute present, regardless of its value.
[data-type] {
  color: red;
}

Group Selectors:
em,
.my-class,
[lang] {
  color: red;
}

p:nth-child(even) {
  background: floralwhite;
}

// + is In opeartor. So: Any child of top
.top + * {
  margin-top: 1.5em;
}

By using the > character, you limit the combinator selector to apply only to direct children.
.top > * {
  margin-top: 1.5em;
}

This wouldn't apply a red color to all links and it would also only apply the red color to .my-class if it was on an <a> element.
a.my-class {
  color: red;
}
