Box Model:

//If padding and border should stay in width %
box-sizing: content-box;


Selectors:

article p:first-of-type {
  color: red;
  font-size: 1.5em;
}


Data types are cool
[data-type='primary'] {
  color: red;
}

Instead of looking for a specific value of data-type, you can also look for elements with the attribute present, regardless of its value.
[data-type] {
  color: red;
}

Group Selectors:
em,
.my-class,
[lang] {
  color: red;
}

p:nth-child(even) {
  background: floralwhite;
}

div:not(.my-class) {
  color: red;
}

Attribute Selector
[href='#'] {
  color: red;
}

Article then all children, then a: So: all a's that are children of article.
article * a {
  margin-top: 1.5em;
}

This will only select children of article
article > a {
  color: maroon;
}

This will affect all children and all other children in article
article a {
  color: maroon;
}

Selects all elements with class 'my-class' & are type <a>
a.my-class {
  color: red;
}

Inheritance:

Unset sets back to default.
  all: unset;
  color: unset;



Units:

Font Size: rem

if html font-size = 62.5%
1 rem = 10px

width: - % + max-width;
on with for items with texts: ch

height: //Do I have to? maybe can use min-height?
if not: rem or %

padding or margin: rem
em = proportional to char. useful for bigger margins etc.
