Units:

Font Size: rem

if html font-size = 62.5%
1 rem = 10px

width: - % + max-width;
on with for items with texts: ch

height: //Do I have to? maybe can use min-height?
if not: rem or %

padding or margin: rem
em = proportional to char. useful for bigger margins etc.


Something like this for width, can also use for height:
width: clamp(15rem, 70vw, 45rem);
Needs % in the middle (or vw/vh)), and left right are rem
