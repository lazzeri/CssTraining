Flexbox
They can display as a row, or a column.
They are single line by default, but can be asked to wrap onto multiple lines.
Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM.
Space can be distributed inside the items, so they become bigger and smaller according to the space available in their parent.
Space can be distributed around the items and flex lines in a wrapped layout, using the Box Alignment properties.
The items themselves can be aligned on the cross axis.

WICHTIG: Rather than selecting children, use .flex-container > *, to select all children.


flex-direction:
row: the items lay out as a row.
row-reverse: the items lay out as a row from the end of the flex container.
column: the items lay out as a column.
column-reverse : the items lay out as a column from the end of the flex container.

//How to add overflow
flex-wrap: wrap;
The initial value of the flex-wrap property is nowrap. This means that if there is not enough space in the container the items will overflow.

//To fill empty space:
flex-grow: 1; to fill.
//To set the size of items
flex-basis: 33% (would let max 3 items into row);


To Make Flex items equal:
flex: 1;


//To shrink or grow size of items:
flex: 1;
flex: 2;
flex: 3;

For gap: gap: 10rem;

//Reorder items:
order: 1,2,3,4

//X - Axis Alignment
justify-content: space distribution on the main axis.
//Y - Axis Alignment
align-items: space distribution on the cross axis.
//X - Y Axis Alignment
place-content: a shorthand for setting both of the above properties.

//To set flex direction of child item that is different from others!
align-self: flex-start

---
MINMAX:
set min and max at same time.



// BIG TUT:

Flex Grow: Sets the distribution of empty space on items.
Example:

//Will distribute free space evenly
    .nav-list li {
    flex-grow: 1;
    }

flex-shrink: If there is not enough space, let items shrink.

flex-wrap: wrap: Lets items Wrap!

flex: 1 = makes all items same size. Actually just changes flex-basis to 0.

//To set flex direction of child item that is different from others!
align-self: flex-start
