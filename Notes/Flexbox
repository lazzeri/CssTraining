Flexbox
They can display as a row, or a column.
They are single line by default, but can be asked to wrap onto multiple lines.
Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM.
Space can be distributed inside the items, so they become bigger and smaller according to the space available in their parent.
Space can be distributed around the items and flex lines in a wrapped layout, using the Box Alignment properties.
The items themselves can be aligned on the cross axis.


flex-direction:
row: the items lay out as a row.
row-reverse: the items lay out as a row from the end of the flex container.
column: the items lay out as a column.
column-reverse : the items lay out as a column from the end of the flex container.

//How to add overflow
flex-wrap: wrap;
The initial value of the flex-wrap property is nowrap. This means that if there is not enough space in the container the items will overflow.

//To shrink or grow size of items:
flex: 1;
flex: 2;
flex: 3;

//Reorder items:
order: 1,2,3,4

//X - Axis Alignment
justify-content: space distribution on the main axis.
//Y - Axis Alignment
align-items: space distribution on the cross axis.
//X - Y Axis Alignment
place-content: a shorthand for setting both of the above properties.

//To set flex direction of child-items
align-self: flex-start
